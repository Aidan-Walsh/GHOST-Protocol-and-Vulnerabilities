# GHOST-Protocol-and-Vulnerabilities

## Private Attack
FinalProjectPrivate.py simulates the private attack on Ethereum's GHOST protocol. The probability that the honest miner mines on the heaviest chain can be tailored, and so can the probability that the adversary mines on its own, private chain (compared to mining on the actual heaviest chain) can be adjusted. 

## Balance Attack
FinalProjectBalance2.py simulates the balance attack on Ethereum's GHOST protocol where the adversary is able to partition the network into two partitions. The adversary's mining power can be adjusted, and the honest miner's probability that it mines on its own chain can be tailored.
